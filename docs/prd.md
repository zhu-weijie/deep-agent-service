### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the **Deep Agent Service**, a production-ready microservice that exposes a highly capable, autonomous AI research agent via a REST API. This service addresses the critical need for AI systems that can perform complex, multi-step tasks requiring planning, tool use, and dynamic adaptationâ€”capabilities beyond the scope of simple, single-shot LLM calls.

### 2. Problem Statement

Standard Large Language Model (LLM) interactions are often stateless and limited by the model's knowledge cutoff. Performing comprehensive research or executing multi-step tasks requires a persistent, stateful framework that can manage context, delegate sub-tasks, and recover from errors. Developers need a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-integrate service that encapsulates this complexity, allowing them to leverage the power of autonomous agents without building the underlying infrastructure from scratch.

### 3. Product Goals

*   **Enable Integration:** Provide a simple but powerful API (`/invoke`, `/stream`) that allows any developer to integrate advanced AI research and task execution capabilities into their applications.
*   **Ensure Reliability:** Deliver a stable, containerized service with predictable performance, robust error handling, and clear, structured logging suitable for production environments.
*   **Promote Extensibility:** Establish a modular architecture where new tools, prompts, and specialized sub-agents can be added with minimal changes to the core service logic.

| FR1.2 | Synchronous Invoke Endpoint  | The service MUST provide a `POST /api/v1/invoke` endpoint that accepts a request, executes the agent synchronously until completion, and returns the agent's complete final state in a single JSON response.                       | Must-Have |
| FR1.3 | Streaming Events Endpoint    | The service MUST provide a `POST /api/v1/stream` endpoint that executes the agent and streams back all intermediate events (LLM calls, tool usage, final answer chunks) in real-time using the Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol. | Must-Have |
| **FR2** | **Core Agent Capabilities**  | The agent MUST possess a core set of capabilities for autonomous task execution.                                                                                                                                                  | Must-Have |

| FR2.2 | Contextual File System     | The agent MUST have the ability to read from and write to an in-memory, per-request virtual file system to manage and offload context during complex operations.                                                                    | Must-Have |
| FR2.3 | Sub-Agent Delegation       | The agent MUST be able to delegate specific sub-tasks to specialized agents that operate in an isolated context, ensuring focused execution and preventing prompt contamination.                                                       | Must-Have |
| **FR3** | **Secure Configuration**     | The service's configuration MUST be managed securely and externally.                                                                                                                                                                | Must-Have |

| NFR6.2 | Request Tracing   | The agent MUST be integrated with a tracing platform like LangSmith to provide full visibility into the agent's execution steps for debugging and performance analysis. This is configured via the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.                                  |
| **NFR7** | **Usability**       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| NFR7.1 | API Documentation | The service MUST automatically generate and host interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation at the `/docs` endpoint.                                                                                                                                  |

### 6. Out of Scope

*   User interface (UI) for interacting with the agent.
*   User authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
*   Persistent, multi-request memory or state. Each API call is treated as a new, independent conversation.
*   Permanent storage of conversation history or generated files in a database.

### 7. Future Roadmap

*   **Persistent State:** Integrate a database backend (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL) to allow conversations to be paused and resumed across multiple API calls.
*   **Enhanced Toolset:** Add more diverse tools, such as a code interpreter or a database query tool.
*   **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** Develop more complex workflows where specialized sub-agents can delegate tasks to each other.
